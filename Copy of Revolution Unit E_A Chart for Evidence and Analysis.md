    <td>The American Revolution</td>
    <td>The American Revolution is a product of the conflict between Britain’s desire to govern the American colonies and its resources and the American colonies’ desire to do the same. 
This conflict arose from a series of taxes and restrictions imposed by the British Government in an effort to make the colonies dependent on British resources, collectively referred to as the Navigation acts (Hindes).</td>
