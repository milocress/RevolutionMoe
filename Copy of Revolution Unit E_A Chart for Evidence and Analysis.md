    <td>The American Revolution</td>
    <td>The American Revolution is a product of the conflict between Britain’s desire to govern the American colonies and its resources and the American colonies’ desire to do the same. 
This conflict arose from a series of taxes and restrictions imposed by the British Government in an effort to make the colonies dependent on British resources, collectively referred to as the Navigation acts (Hindes).</td>
    <td>
</td>
    <td>Protests, boycotts, the Boston tea party, the formation of the continental congress, the allocation of funds and weapons for militias</td>
    <td>Initially, Britain responded by relaxing regulations to appease the colonists, but as time went on, the British government began to implement policies intended to strip the colonies of their autonomy in order to keep them loyal to Britain.</td>
    <td>After a long and bloody war, America emerges as a sovereign nation, free to pursue its own ends.</td>

    <td>“The financial crisis, which could never happen today, was simply the latest in a series of murderous 20th century catastrophes which had originated entirely in human brains. From the violence people were doing to themselves and each other, and to all living things, for that matter, a visitor from another planet might have assumed that the environment had gone haywire, and that the people were in such a frenzy because Nature was about to kill them all” (Vonnegut)
CITE ME.</td>
    <td> “Mary had also taught that the human brain was the most admirable survival device yet produced by evolution. But now her own big brain was urging her to take the polyethylene garment bag and wrap it around her head, thus depriving her cells of oxygen” (Vonnegut).</td>
    <td>First, a preface on my take on the revolutions presented in the book: I believe it would be shortsighted to see this as a book about Nature’s revolution against humanity, as this would imply that humanity had control over the world in the first place. I believe that though the book’s scope spans the declining fears of the human race’s intelligence, the scope of the revolution reaches from the beginnings of human sentience all the way to its end.
