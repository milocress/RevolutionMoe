I want to write about the interaction between different cultures of revolution and the environments around them.

I really donâ€™t want to make this narrative be a cheesy and awkward mashup of the books and events we read about, but rather a meaningful exploration of what it means to be human, to have and maintain power, and to rebel against the status quo.

I think there are a few ways to go about this. I want a third-person narrator who sees multiple story lines play out and interact with each other over the course of millennia.
