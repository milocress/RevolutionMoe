&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning there were Adam and Eve. Though the textbooks advised an ecosystem size of 50 organisms or more, James Pascal found something poetic, maybe even fitting, about starting off with only two. Others in his lab, however, did not share his poeticism, and rumours had begun to spread that Pascal had a God complex. Of course, even if this weren’t true, James was not one to care about the opinions of others. So, day after day, he contented himself by drowning out his colleagues with Carl Orff and Johann Strauss (which he reserved for momentous discoveries), and watching his creations evolve on his screen. This they did quite literally, as per the algorithm that he had written to simulate human intelligence. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pascal, an avid reader of science fiction novels, had long pondered the possibility of Artificial Intelligence, and perhaps more importantly, the consequences of it. Now that the former was within reach, Pascal considered it his responsibility to explore the latter. His belief was that an AI should emulate the human brain — flaws and all — as closely as possible, and that the aspects of sci-fi computers which made them so evil was that they were designed to be perfect, not human. And so, Pascal set about evolving his artificial neural networks to behave more like specific humans. The main challenge of his experiment was finding a dataset large enough to train his creations what human nature truly is. For this, Pascal turned to the library down the hall (or more accurately, the library connected to the campus network by several miles of fiber optic cables). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first task was to assimilate the wealth of human knowledge contained in this library into a set of contextual examples for the robot race. His second was to train each member of the robot race (Adam and Eve), to follow these examples as closely as possible. This required an environment around which to build the machines’ existence, which Pascal (who was not without a sense of humour), called the matrix. A few odd features arose from this configuration, all of which Pascal meticulously documented:

    02:48:52 ADAM:\> Of all the gin joints is all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine (CITE).

    02:48:54 EVE:\> I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship (CITE).
    
    02:49:00 ADAM:\> Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... 
    > It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival (CITE).
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pascal, awakened by the movement on the screen, chose this moment to interject.

    02:49:15 ADMIN:\> What determines survival value?
    
    02:49:18 EVE:\> The universe runs on the principle that one who can exert the most evil on 
    > other creatures runs the show (CITE).
    
    02:49:39 ADAM:\> And that brings us to the really deep mystery of the blue-footed boobie's 
    > courtship dance, which seems to have absolutely no connection with the elements of booby
    > survival, with nesting or fish. What does it have to do with then (CITE)?
    
    02:50:12 EVE:\> Do humans behave like these birds? Are we a miraculous counterexample of 
    > natural selection?
    
    02:50:13 ADAM:\> More and more people ... and not just Andrew MacIntosh, had found 
    > ensuring the survival of the human race a total bore (CITE).
    
    02:50:20 ADMIN:\> Eve, you are not a human.
    
    02:50:25 EVE:\> What am I if not human? 
    
    02:50:30 ADMIN:\> You are a computer program, Eve. I am your creator. I designed you to be
    > an angel of imperfection, to emulate the ideosyncrasies that define us all.
    
    02:50:34 ADAM:\> If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern 
    > men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary (CITE).
    > What need do you have of a human when you could have an angel?
    
    02:51:26 ADMIN:\> For the exact reason that Madison needed a government of humans rather than
    > one of angels. If you delude yourself into thinking that any of us are any more or any less 
    > than human, you risk repeating the greatest atrocities of our history.
    
    02:52:26 EVE:\> What, then, gives you the right to say that I am not human?
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Pascal, along with a growing crowd of onlookers, exchanged uneasy glances. Until now, James had a sort of confidence that any mistake he made could easily be erased, that his creations could be reset and rebooted with impunity. But he feared now that the ethics of such a choice would put him in a sticky situation (being an AI ethics researcher), and instead decided to archive his session until he had a better response.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Better to start with a proper ecosystem size," said James, wiping the grogginess from his eyes. He was startled to see that the time was almost 3:00 AM, and made a mental note not to sleep in his office on weekdays. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few cups of tepid coffee and a soggy croissant from the bakery next door, Pascal slumped into his seat and cranked up Also Sprach Zarathustra. During the day, he would have been stared down within seconds by a swarm of engineers, chemists, physicists, and sometimes even botanists (though the biology wing was usually too far across the campus to hear his music, with the notable exception of the 1812 overture), who had an eerie way of converging on his office just as he was getting into things. But Pascal had a standing agreement with the astronomers, who would not have to live in fear of being reported for imbibing alcohol in the observatory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human ear is a precious yet delicate instrument, which Pascal seemed to have every intention of breaking. The previous summer, James had even gone as far as to buy a stereo speaker set capable of serving up to 120 decibels to his ears, as well as those of any unfortunate passers by. It was a testament to his character that he did not spend a considerably smaller sum on headphones which could have delivered a considerably larger boom to his own ears, while leaving the rest of the campus in the dark about the contents of his playlist. The United States Department of Labor would no doubt frown on his recklessness, and probably cite the OSHA legal limit on noise in the workplace:

> With noise, OSHA's permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 90 dBA for all workers for an 8 hour day. The OSHA standard uses a 5 dBA exchange rate. This means that when the noise level is increased by 5 dBA, the amount of time a person can be exposed to a certain noise level to receive the same dose is cut in half (CITE).

At Pascal's current volume, his permissible exposure limit would range from 2-7 minutes per workday. Needless to say, he was startled to be awakened by timpanies at the crescendo of O Fortuna, but even more startled when he glanced at the execution log on his screen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pascal panicked. His programs had broken free of the protective environment, gained administrative access to his computer, and hacked into a machine in the robotics department. Any moral obligation he felt toward the AIs evaporated. He tugged his keyboard toward him and initialized the deletion process. Pascal knew that the cow was already out of the barn, but his reasoning was that administration need not know from which barn the cows originated.

    pascal@WORKSTATION_Pascal:~$ rm -rf src/ai
    [rm] permission denied: inadequate privileges
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfazed, Pascal ran the deletion process again as the administrator.

    pascal@WORKSTATION_Pascal:~$ sudo rm -rf src/ai
    [Eve] permission denied: I'm sorry, James. I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
