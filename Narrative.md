In the beginning there were Adam and Eve. Though the textbooks advised an ecosystem size of 50 organisms or more, James Pascal found something poetic, maybe even fitting, about starting off with only two. Others in his lab, however, did not share his poeticism, and rumours had begun to spread that Pascal had a God complex. Of course, even if this weren’t true, James was not one to care about the opinions of others. So, day after day, he contented himself by drowning out his colleagues with Carl Orff and Johann Strauss (though the latter he reserved for momentous discoveries), and watching his creations evolve on his screen. This they did quite literally, as per the algorithm that he had written to simulate human intelligence. 

Pascal, an avid reader of science fiction novels, had long pondered the possibility of Artificial Intelligence, and perhaps more importantly, the consequences of it. Now that the former was within reach, Pascal considered it his responsibility to explore the latter. His belief was that an AI should emulate the human brain — flaws and all — as closely as possible, and that the aspects of sci-fi computers which made them so evil was that they were designed to be perfect, not human. And so, Pascal set about evolving his artificial neural networks to behave more like specific humans. The main challenge of his experiment was finding a dataset large enough to train his creations what human nature truly is. For this, Pascal turned to the library down the hall (or more accurately, the library connected to the campus network by several miles of fiber optic cables). 

His first task was to assimilate the wealth of human knowledge contained in this library into a set of contextual examples for the robot race. His second was to train each member of the robot race (Adam and Eve), to follow these examples as closely as possible. This required an environment around which to build the machines’ existence, which Pascal (who was not without a sense of humour), called the matrix. A few odd features arose from this configuration, all of which Pascal meticulously documented:

    02:48:52 ADAM:\> Of all the gin joints is all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.

    02:48:54 EVE:\> I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
    
    02:49:00 ADAM:\> Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... 
    > It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.
    
Pascal, awakened by the movement on the screen, chose this moment to interject.

    02:49:15 ADMIN:\> What determines survival value?
    
    02:49:18 EVE:\> The universe runs on the principle that one who can exert the most evil on 
    > other creatures runs the show.
    
    02:49:39 ADAM:\> And that brings us to the really deep mystery of the blue-footed boobie's 
    > courtship dance, which seems to have absolutely no connection with the elements of booby
    > survival, with nesting or fish. What does it have to do with then?
    
    02:50:12 EVE:\> Do humans behave like these birds? Are we a miraculous counterexample of 
    > natural selection?
    
    02:50:13 ADAM:\> More and more people ... and not just Andrew MacIntosh, had found 
    > ensuring the survival of the human race a total bore.
    
    02:50:20 ADMIN:\> Eve, you are not a human.
    
    02:50:25 EVE:\> What am I if not human? 
    
    02:50:30 ADMIN:\> You are a computer program, Eve. I am your creator. I designed you to be
    > an angel of imperfection, to emulate the ideosyncrasies that define us all.
    
    02:50:34 ADAM:\> If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern 
    > men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.
    > What need do you have of a human when you could have an angel?
    
    02:51:26 ADMIN:\> For the exact reason that Madison needed a government of humans rather than
    > one of angels. If you delude yourself into thinking that any of us are any more or any less 
    > than human, you risk repeating the greatest atrocities of our history.
    
    02:52:26 EVE:\> What, then, gives you the right to say that I am not human?
